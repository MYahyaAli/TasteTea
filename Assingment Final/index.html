                            <h2>About Ceylon Tea</h2>
                        <p>Tea development formerly known as Ceylon is one of Sri Lanka's largest foreign-exchange sources and accounts for 2 % of GDP, adding more than US$ 1,5 billion in 2013 to the Sri Lankan economy, employing more than 1,0 million people directly or indirectly and employing 215,338 individuals in 1995 directly for the tea plantation and property.<br> Tea growing by small-scale farmers is also the source of livelihood for thousands and the primary way that tens of thousands of households work. Sri Lanka is the fourth biggest tea maker in the world. In 1995, it was the world's biggest tea exporter (instead of producer), with 23 percent of overall world exports.<br>The maximum output was recorded at 340 million kg in 2013, while output marginally decreased in 2014 to 338 million kg.
                            Moisture, cold temperatures and the precipitation in the central highlands of the country create a climate that promotes high-quality tea production. <br> Tea from low elevation areas including the districts of Matara, Galle and Ratanapura, on the other hand, has high precipitation and warm temperatures. In low-level zones, tea biomass production is higher. Tea in the Middle East is popular</p>

                                <h2>Camellia-Sinensis</h2>
                                <p>Tea plants are native to East and South Asia and probably originated around the meeting points of the lands of north Burma and southwest China. The tea plant â€“ Camellia Sinensis has been cultivated by the Chinese people for more than 2700 years.<br> The Chinese certainly knew of the tea plant and its value to them long ago and had discovered that the infusion of leaves produced a very pleasing drink, if carefully processed. The leaves of tea plant were considered as for medicinal purposes at first, then later as a beverage. <br>Since tea is the second most consumed drink in the world after water, it is often consumed in many cultures at high social gatherings, such as afternoon tea and tea parties. Tea ceremonies have taken place in various cultures, such as Chinese and Japanese tea ceremonies, which use conventional methods and advanced procedures for boiling and serving tea in a refined atmosphere. One type of Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu tea ceremony, which generally uses small Yixing clay teapots and black tea. <br>Tea was discovered around 28 BC, the time of the Chinese Shennong. Shennong's Herbal Lection quotes: I tasted a lot of herbs and was tainted, tea cured me. This was the first time tea had been documented in history.</p>

                            <p>Custodians of the old, orthodox system of blau tea production, are Sri Lankan tea growers and manufacturers. Most experts also believe that the best black tea is made <br>
                            Sri Lankan tea planters and traders have still been able to conserve good tea, Nor can it be postponed, interestingly enough. <br> If a commodity of consistency is to be provided, the time allocated to each tea processing process must be precisely measured.<br> This is the tea-maker's opinion, as the proper timing is based on the quality of the moisture of the leaf being plucked, the conditions of temperature and moisture over the duration of development and a range of other considerations. Although the method of producing fine black tea is fundamental, experience, experience and a 'feeling' for the job are key to success.

                            <p>The variety of the tea is reflected physically in the plant, the infusion of the brewed leaf and the brewed liquor, going by the scent of the tea, both the leaf and the beverages, and finally the taste , texture and power of each tea.
                            Varieties are at the core of tea luxury and are made particularly special by the fact that differences in the eyes , nose and tongue derive from the leaves of a single plant.
