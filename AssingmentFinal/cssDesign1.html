                    <p>It is vital to pay special attention to many forecast variables in tea prices, which include environmental issues and its negative effects, while monitoring the supply and demand equation, current international economic conditions, uncertainty in major Ceylon Tea countries, also equally significant.
                        <br> Tea is the best-consuming drink in the world, except for water and tea consumption analysts expect that China is a major part of its rising growth and that it is closely watched by India. China has gradually influenced global demand for black tea and is also expected to increase in the coming year. From Sri Lanka's viewpoint, exports to China saw substantial gains.
                       <br> Tea market demand will certainly depend on how the global tea industry performs over the first half for the second half of the year. Sri Lanka sells one kilo of tea at some of the best prices in the country. Higher output costs, lower yield and an adverse tea brewing age profile have contributed to reduced income. 
                       <br> A higher production and cost reduction may be necessary to improve competition in the world market of 'Ceylon Teas' in the medium to long term. Consequently, 'Ceylon Teasâ€™ global competitiveness will depend heavily on industry's rapid response to these important issues.
